### Use AI to Help You Contribute

You don't need to be an expert developer. Agentic coding tools let you contribute using natural language.

**Option 1: Claude (Web)**
1. Fork this repo
2. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and connect your fork as a project
3. Tell it what you want to change in plain English — it reads the code, makes the edits, and commits

**Option 2: Claude Code (CLI)**
1. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
2. Fork and clone this repo
3. Run `claude` in the project directory and start talking

Both tools handle the code, git, and everything else. You just describe what you want built or fixed.

### Code Style
- Keep it simple and readable
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks beyond Three.js)
- Comment anything non-obvious
- Test your changes in the browser before submitting

### Pull Request Process
1. PRs are reviewed by maintainers
2. Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
3. Include a brief description of what changed and why
