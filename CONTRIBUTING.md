### Use AI to Help You Contribute

You don't need to be an expert developer. Agentic coding tools can do the heavy lifting:

**Option 1: Claude (Web)**
1. Fork this repo and clone it locally
2. Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
3. Paste the relevant code files into the chat
4. Describe the change you want in plain English (e.g. "Add a move counter that increments each time a face is rotated")
5. Copy the generated code back into your files
6. Test with `npm run dev`, commit, and open a PR

**Option 2: Claude Code (CLI)**
1. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
2. Fork and clone this repo
3. Run `claude` in the project directory
4. Tell it what to build or fix — it reads the codebase, makes changes, and can even commit for you
5. Review the changes, push, and open a PR

This is a great way to learn coding through AI-assisted development. The AI handles the syntax, you provide the ideas.

### Code Style
- Keep it simple and readable
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks beyond Three.js)
- Comment anything non-obvious
- Test your changes in the browser before submitting

### Pull Request Process
1. PRs are reviewed by maintainers
2. Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
3. Include a brief description of what changed and why
